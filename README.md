# ☕ Starbucks Clone

A **self-made clone** of the **Starbucks** website, built as a personal project to test and improve frontend development skills. This project showcases **Vue 3**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Swiper.js**, with a strong focus on **smooth animations, interactive Swipers, and form validation**.

✅ **Menu Page** (including **Menu, Featured Previous, and Favorites** subpages)\
✅ **Rewards Page**\
✅ **Gift Cards Page** (featuring Swiper.js carousels)\
